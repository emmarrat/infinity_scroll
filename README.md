## Infinite scrolling in React with the Intersection Observer API 📜🔄

## Overview

Infinity Scroll is a React application that uses the Intersection Observer API to load content smoothly and dynamically. This app stack: React, TypeScript, Axios for data retrieval, and Material UI to create a user interface.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: New content loads automatically as it reaches the end of the page. 🔄
- **Customized Hook for Intersection Observer API**: I've created a custom React hook to utilize the capabilities of the Intersection Observer API. This provides efficient and performant handling of content loading based on the visibility of the element in the viewport. ⚙️

## Technologies used.

- **React** 
- **TypeScript** 
- **Axios** 
- **Material UI** 

## Data Source.

For demonstration purposes, used [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com), a service that provides free fake data. This allows demonstrating the functionality of infinite scrolling on realistic content. 🧑‍💻
